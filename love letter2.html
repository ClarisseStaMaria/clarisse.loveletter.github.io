                            Don’t be afraid to reach towards the sky and dream big –even if you might be small in comparison to the vast universe. Jump and soar with all of your might and camera in hand. Explore, hop from star corner to star corner and capture all the cosmic particles that circles around you. Create a kingdom upon the clouds and a castle out of Venus’ rocks. Glide across the milky way and race with the comets with every step that you make, you are the painting in the canvas of the world and connecting its constellations.
                            
                            
                            <hr>
                            
                            
                            As you are gathering the pieces of moonlight to help guide others, don’t forget to save some of that glow for yourself. No matter how far you wander and even when the sky is covered by darkened clouds, the moon will do its best to illuminate your path and tell you that you’ve done well, before the stars take their turn to bid you goodnight.

                            Thank you for the light that you are bringing to this world and for allowing us to be part of your story- your scenery. Remember that there are many people who are willing to share our own light with you and many of the universe’ wonders are by your side. So don’t worry and keep going, collect every memory that you create and lock them within black and white.
